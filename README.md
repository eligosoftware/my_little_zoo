My little zoo


Description

The game in SNAP. The idea is based on using classification result from Jetson device and "feed" 5 

different animal with 5 different fruits. The following mapping is suggested:

Animal to vegetable/fruits mapping

rabbit - carrot
mouse - broccoli
squirrel - orange
worm - apple
monkey - banana

Animals can be with random names.

When the animal "sees" the food through jetson camera or laptop webcamera, it should show own delight while others can show disappointment. The background of the stage can be forest area with sun and clouds. The goal is to feed your animal before the others. The first 3 animals that eats 10 fruits win their medals (gold, silver, bronze).

Plan of works


1. Create background for three stages (start screen, game screen, and game over/ award scene)
2. Place animals on 5 positions with scores under them
3. On each classification place the image of food on the top.
4. (difficult part) if any animal matches to the classified food, show animation of happiness, and animation of disappointment of the other. Increment points.
5. Place an image of golden, silver, bronze cups near points, once they reach 10 points.
6. After bronze cup, show game over screen with award winners and repeat button.
